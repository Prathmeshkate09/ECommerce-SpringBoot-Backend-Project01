# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend API

## 📘 Overview  
Developed a fully functional **RESTful API** for an E-Commerce platform using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**.  
The backend system manages user authentication, product catalog, cart, and order processing — implementing complete CRUD operations with data validation and exception handling.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of **backend architecture, REST API design, database structuring, and object-oriented principles** — directly aligning with the requirements of a **Java Backend Developer** role.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied  
| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Designed modular, maintainable code using classes, inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation. |
| **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** | Applied efficient searching and sorting logic for product and order management, ensuring optimized response times. |
| **Java (Core + Advanced)** | Built backend business logic using Java collections, exception handling, and stream APIs. |
| **REST APIs** | Created secure and scalable endpoints for CRUD operations following RESTful principles. |
| **Spring Boot & Spring Data JPA** | Simplified development and ORM with JPA and Hibernate for smooth database communication. |
| **SQL & Database Design** | Structured normalized relational schemas, implemented joins, and optimized queries for better performance. |
| **Exception Handling & Debugging** | Implemented global exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice`, improving API reliability and maintainability. |
| **Code Review & Collaboration** | Followed version control best practices using Git/GitHub and participated in collaborative code reviews. |
